# Welcome! 
## Actually you are watching my JBC soldering station project. 
## Version 1 will be improved at some points however it works fine too.
#### Planned Improvements:
##### Software and application 
- USB-C connector will be used to update the software in DFU mode. USB2.0 HS will be used
- FREERTOS will be used for task scheduling 
- The software application will be more flexible for migrate to other MCUs
- StemWin GUI will remain for STM32F4 or higher, 16x2 LCD driver will be used for slower MCUs 
- ...

##### Hardware and PCB
- PCB will remain the same size 
- AC transformer with triac will remain to avoid SMPS's high frequency noise
- Opamp will be revised if it is possible it will be changed to a better one
- Zero crossing detection may be changed to a more simple one
- Ambient temperature sensor and I2C connection will be removed
- ...
